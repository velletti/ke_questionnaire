**Fork for TYPO3 9 LTS**

This is NOT the offical Version of ke_questionnaire!
=======================================================
I just made a fork and made changes, that enables the USE of TYPO3 8-LTS  (and now also LTS 9 )
Actual development is only on Branch TYPO3-9-LTS 

Adjustments for LTS 10 are planned for Q4 / 2021. 

### IMPORTANT Breaking changes 
================================================
 files from 'uploadfolder' => 'uploads/tx_kequestionnaire' are not supported anymore
 You need to migrate such attached images to Questions and Answers to FAL
 as i did not use this kind of data, i do NOT plan to develope a migration wizard
 
 
 *If You need this:*
 You have to copy this files from uploads/tx_kequestionnaire to fileadmin/user_upload/tx_kequestionnaire
 
 run indexer for Files to have sys_file entries and create sys_file_references between  
 question / Answer and then replace the value form the field with 1

### Minor Breaking changes 
================================================
 The empty partial PageBreak.html was renamed from lowercase Pagebreak.html to camelCase PageBreak.html

================================================

Things i have done:
- Moved all needed Code from ext_tables to Configuration\TCA 
- Needed changes in TCA (lll references, richtext and Field config changes like sys_language_uid)
- added TCA\Overrrides\tt_content.php and sys_template.php

- should be still compatible with premium Version of ke_questionnaire (if there is a 8 TLS version), but i did not test this.
- Not tested with older Versions of TYPO3
- Not tested dependencies and ranges as not used in my projects
- Fixed a bug in Export-as-csv file, to allow excel to open the file directly instead of need to open file in Excel as TXT File, select charset etc.

- moved settings.showAvarage to access tab because in layout tab the display conditions does not work as with settings.accessType

## Added new features: 
Maybe also it would be possible to use hooks/signalslot to receice this, i decide to integrate my features directly, as it looks as there will be no further developement of ke_questionnaire.
The added features are:
- Choose X Random Questions from question pool and max random questions per page
- max. time in seconds for total questionnaire
- Possability in extension configuration to disable in backendcotroller, that the list of feusers, feGroups or tt Addresses are loaded
 (will run into memory problem in Installations with lots of fe users, groups or tt_addresses)


I also changed configuration\flexforms\questionnaire.xlm to be able to configure this 2 new features.
if you have your own flexform, you need to copy this 3 new fields to your flexform.



## TODO-List:

Maybe we need also to adjust file view/chart.php
it uses:
- TYPO3\CMS\Fluid\View\TemplateView->getLayoutRootPath() 
since fluid 8.7 is removed. Need to use getLayoutRootPaths()

## Breaking changes

If you have changed the template:
ke_questionnaire/Resources/Private/Templates/Backend/AuthCodesMail.html
or the partial:
ke_questionnaire/Resources/Private/Partials/Backend/CreateAndMailAuthCodes.html

you need to adjust this:
(You need to handover to the partial parameter 'text' and render the Email preview inside of the template )

Most Templates have to be adjusted for LTS9, see Git Repositorys history
Removed outdate Arguments in Backend Viewhalpers
added sometimes now <format.raw> 


### - LTS 9 
Add this to your config/sites/<site>.yaml
imports:
  - { resource: "EXT:ke_questionnaire/Configuration/Routing/routes.yaml" }
